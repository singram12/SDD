**To Re-phrase:**
The SDD data format anticipates that with increasing use cases, numbering schemes will need to be expanded to define
additional details or options in some fields. In order to keep the numbering scheme unique and continue to allow users
to share their SDD files without ambiguity, we recommend that requests for new numbering schemes are submitted to the
SDD collaboration (represented by the authors of this manuscript, headed by the groups at Massachusetts General Hospital
/ Harvard Medical School, University of Manchester and Queenâ€™s University Belfast). Each new specification for fields
in the header or data block will be assigned a specified number and documentation about all fields will be provided
and updated.
